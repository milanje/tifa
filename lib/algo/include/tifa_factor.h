    * \brief Generic Integer factorization.
    *
    * Attempts to factor the non perfect square integer \c n with the
    * most suitable algorithm (chosen according to the size of \c n)
    * and with the factoring mode given by <tt>mode</tt>. Found factors are
    * then stored in \c factors. Additionally, if the factoring mode used is
    * set to \c FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION, factors' multiplicities are stored
    * in the array <tt>multis</tt>. For the time being, no trial divisions
    * are performed so depending on the situation, it could be worthwhile to
    * carry out such a step <i>before</i> calling \c tifa_factor.
    *
    * \note If the factoring mode used is different from
    * \c FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION, \c multis is allowed to be a NULL
    * pointer. Otherwise, using a NULL pointer will lead to a fatal error.
    *
    * \warning If the \c factors and \c multis arrays have not enough room
    * to store the found factors (and the multiplicities, if any), they will
    * be automatically resized to accommodate the data. This has to be kept
    * in mind when trying to do ingenious stuff with memory management (hint:
    * don't try to be clever here).
    *
    * \param[out] factors Pointer to the found factors of <tt>n</tt>.
    * \param[out] multis Pointer to the multiplicities of the found factors
    *                    (only computed if \c mode is set to
    *                     \c FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION).
    * \param[in] n The non perfect square integer to factor.
    * \param[in] mode The factoring mode to use.
    * \return An exit code.
