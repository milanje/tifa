 *
 * \brief The SQUFOF factorization algorithm.
 *
 * This is the TIFA library's implementation of Shanks' square form
 * factorization algorithm (SQUFOF), based on the description given by Jason
 * Gower and Samuel Wagstaff in their paper "Square Form Factorization" to be
 * published in Mathematics of Computation.
 *
 * \note This implementation can only factor numbers whose size is less than
 * twice the size of an \c unsigned \c long \c int.

    * \brief Integer factorization via the square form factorization
    * (SQUFOF) algorithm.
    *
    * Attempts to factor the non perfect square integer \c n with the
    * SQUFOF algorithm, using the factoring mode given by <tt>mode</tt>.
    * Found factors are then stored in \c factors. Additionally, if the
    * factoring mode used is set to FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION,
    * factors' multiplicities are stored in the array <tt>multis</tt>.
    *
    * \warning This implementation can only factor numbers whose sizes in bits
    * are strictly less than twice the size of an <tt>unsigned long int</tt>
    * (the exact limit depending on the number to factor and the multiplier
    * used). This choice was made because most of the computations are
    * then performed using only single precision operations. Such a limitation
    * should not be much of a problem since SQUFOF is mostly used to factor
    * very small integers (up to, say, 20 decimal digits).
    *
    * \note If the factoring mode used is different from
    * FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION, \c multis is allowed to be a NULL pointer.
    * Otherwise, using a NULL pointer will lead to a fatal error.
    *
    * \warning If the \c factors and \c multis arrays have not enough room
    * to store the found factors (and the multiplicities, if any), they will
    * be automatically resized to accommodate the data. This has to be kept
    * in mind when trying to do ingenious stuff with memory management (hint:
    * don't try to be clever here).
    *
    * \param[out] factors Pointer to the found factors of <tt>n</tt>.
    * \param[out] multis Pointer to the multiplicities of the found factors
    *                    (only computed if \c mode is set to
    *                     FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION).
    * \param[in] n The non perfect square integer to factor.
    * \param[in] params SQUFOF's parameters (currently unused).
    * \param[in] mode The factoring mode to use.
