 * \brief McKee's variant of the Fermat factorization algorithm.
 *
 * This is the TIFA library's implementation of James McKee's proposed speedup
 * of the Fermat factorization algorithm (SQUFOF), based on the description
 * given by McKee in its paper "Speeding Fermat's Factoring Method".
 *
 * \note This implementation can only factor numbers whose size is less than
 * twice the size of an \c unsigned \c long \c int.

    * \brief Integer factorization via McKee's speedup of Fermat's factorization
    * algorithm.
    *
    * Attempts to factor the non perfect square integer \c n using James McKee's
    * proposed enhancement of Fermat's algorithm, using the factoring mode given
    * by <tt>mode</tt>. Found factors are then stored in \c factors.
    * Additionally, if the factoring mode used is set to
    * FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION, factors' multiplicities are stored in the
    * array <tt>multis</tt>.
    *
    * \warning This implementation can only factor numbers whose sizes in bits
    * are strictly less than twice the size of an <tt>unsigned long int</tt>.
    * This choice was made to maximize the use of single precision operations.
    * Such a limitation should not be much of a problem since Fermat's algorithm
    * is mostly used to factor very small integers (up to, say, 20 decimal
    * digits).
    *
    * \note If the factoring mode used is different from
    * FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION, \c multis is allowed to be a NULL pointer.
    * Otherwise, using a NULL pointer will lead to a fatal error.
    *
    * \warning If the \c factors and \c multis arrays have not enough room
    * to store the found factors (and the multiplicities, if any), they will
    * be automatically resized to accommodate the data. This has to be kept
    * in mind when trying to do ingenious stuff with memory management (hint:
    * don't try to be clever here).
    *
    * \param[out] factors Pointer to the found factors of <tt>n</tt>.
    * \param[out] multis Pointer to the multiplicities of the found factors
    *                    (only computed if \c mode is set to
    *                     FIND_COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION).
    * \param[in] n The non perfect square integer to factor.
    * \param[in] params Fermat's algorithm parameters (currently unused).
    * \param[in] mode The factoring mode to use.
    * \return An exit code.
