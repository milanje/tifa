    * \brief Integer factorization via trial division (TDIV).
    *
    * Attempts to factor the integer \c n via trial division by the first
    * \c nprimes primes. Found factors are then stored in the array \c factors
    * and multiplicities are stored in <tt>multis</tt>.
    *
    * Returns:
    * \li \c COMPLETE_FACTORIZATION_FOUND if the complete factorization of
    *                                     \c n was found.
    *
    * \li \c SOME_FACTORS_FOUND if some factors were found but could not
    *                           account for the complete factorization of \c n.
    *                           In that case, the unfactored part of \c n is
    *                           stored in
    *                           \c factors->data[\c factors->lenth - 1].
    *
    * \li \c NO_FACTOR_FOUND if no factor were found.
    *
    * \warning The prime numbers are not computed but read from a table.
    * Consequently the number of primes \c nprimes should be less than or equal
    * to \c NFIRST_PRIMES (defined in \link array.h \endlink). If \c nprimes is
    * zero, then the default value \c DFLT_TDIV_NPRIMES will be used instead.
    *
    * \param[out] factors Pointer to the found factors of <tt>n</tt>.
    * \param[out] multis  Pointer to the multiplicities of the found factors.
    * \param[in]  n       The integer to factor.
    * \param[in]  nprimes The number of primes to trial divide \c n by.
    * \return     An exit code.
