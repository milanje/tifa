 * \date    Tue Oct 11 2011
 * \version 2011-10-11
 *
 * \brief The elliptic curve method of integer factorization (ECM).
 *
 * This is the TIFA library's implementation of the 'ECM' factorization
 * algorithm. The second phase of the algorithm follows the standard
 * continuation and is implemented in a way reminiscent of the description
 * given in the article "Implementing the Elliptic Curve Method of Factoring
 * in Reconfigurable Hardware" by Kris Gaj et al.
 *
 * \see "Implementing the Elliptic Curve Method of Factoring in Reconfigurable
 * Hardware", K. Gaj et al., <i>Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems -
 * CHES 2006</i>.
 *
 * \warning This is merely a toy-implementation of ECM without any smart
 * optimizations. More work is certainly needed to make it competitive
 * for small numbers. Large numbers are, of course, out of the scope of this
 * library.
