 *
 * \brief Continued fraction expansion for square root of integers.
 *
 * Defines the continued fraction expansion for the square root of non-perfect
 * square integers.
 *
 * The expansion is computed via an iterative process, each step giving the
 * value of a new numerator. All the variables needed to perform this
 * computation is stored in an ad-hoc structure called
 * <tt>struct_cont_frac_state_t</tt>.
 *
 * \note Since the denominator of the continued fraction is not
 * used in the CFRAC algorithm, it is not computed here. Also, the numerator
 * of the fraction is only given modulo n. These restrictions are completely
 * trivial to fix should one need the complete approximation a/b of a square
 * root.
