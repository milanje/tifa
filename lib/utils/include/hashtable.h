    * type of elements, provided that suitable comparison and hash functions
    * exist for the type of the keys used.
    *
    * This hashtable implementation uses a simple sequential search in a linked
    * list to solve the collisions.
    *
    * \warning Due to limitations in the current implementation, it is
    * strongly advised to use \e only pointers to integers or strings as
    * keys.
