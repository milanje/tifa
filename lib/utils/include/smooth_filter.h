 * \file    smooth_filter.h
 * \author  Jerome Milan
 * \date    Tue Oct 11 2011
 * \version 2011-10-11
 *
 * \brief Smooth integer filter.
 *
 * The \c smooth_filter_t structure and its associated functions implement the
 * multi-step early abort strategy in a way reminiscent of Pomerance's 
 * suggestion in "Analysis and Comparison of Some Integer Factoring Algorithm" 
 * with the exception that the smoothness tests are performed by batch 
 * (see bernsteinisms.h) instead of trial division.
 * 
 * <h3>How to use a \c smooth_filter_t structure?</h3>
 *
 * The following code snippet, while incomplete, illustrates the way a
 * \c smooth_filter_t should be used.
 *
 * \verbatim
  //
  // Fill the with the smooth_filter_t with our parameters...
  //
  smooth_filter_t filter;
  filter.n          = n;    // number to factor
  filter.kn         = kn;   // number to factor x multiplier
  filter.batch_size = 1024; // number of relations to perform a batch
  filter.methid     = TDIV_EARLY_ABORT; // use the early abort strategy
  filter.nsteps     = 2;    // use a 2-step early abort strategy
  
  filter.htable                 = htable;
  filter.use_large_primes       = true;
  filter.use_siqs_batch_variant = false;
  
  filter.base_size    = factor_base->length; // size of factor base
  filter.candidate_xi = candidate_xi; // candidate relations stored
  filter.candidate_yi = candidate_yi; // in candidate_* arrays
  filter.accepted_xi  = accepted_xi;  // 'good' relations stored
  filter.accepted_yi  = accepted_yi;  // in accepted_* arrays
  //
  // Complete the filter initialization by allocating its internal
  // buffers, computing the early abort bounds and the intermediate
  // factor bases...
  //
  complete_filter_init(&filter, factor_base);
  
  while (accepted_yi->length != nrels_to_collect) {
      //
      // While we don't have enough relations, create new ones and
      // stores them in the candidate_* arrays such that
      // yi = xi^2 (mod kn). (The generate_relations function here
      // is completely fictitious)
      //
      generate_relations(candidate_xi, candidate_yi);
      
      //
      // Select 'good' relations such that yi = xi^2 (mod kn) with
      // yi smooth. Note that pointers to the candidate_* and
      // accepted_* arrays were given in the filter structure.
      //
      filter_new_relations(&filter);
  }
  //
  // This clears _only_ the memory allocated by complete_init_filter.
  //
  clear_smooth_filter(&filter);
