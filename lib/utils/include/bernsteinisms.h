    * \brief Daniel J. Bernstein's algorithm 2.1 modified for SIQS, with large
    * primes variation (with computation of a remainder tree).
    *
    * Given <tt>z</tt>, the product of prime numbers p_j and the positive
    * integers y_i listed by <tt>cand_yi</tt>, determines the y_i that are
    * {p_j}-smooth and stores them in <tt>smooth_yi</tt>, so that
    * \c smooth_yi->data[i] is indeed {p_j}-smooth.
    *
    * In a typical factorization problem, we other found ourselves in situations
    * where each y_i is associated to another integer x_i. The x_i associated
    * to the {p_j}-smooth y_i are hence stored in <tt>xi</tt>.
    *
    * Moreover, this function implements the so-called large primes variation.
    * If a given y_i is not {p_j}-smooth but is the product of a prime \c p by
    * a {p_j}-smooth number, it is stored in the hashtable <tt>htable</tt>.
    * Subsequently, if another y_j is the product of a {p_j}-smooth number
    * by the same prime number \c p, then <tt>y_i*y_j/(p^2)</tt> is stored in
    * \c smooth_yi and <tt>x_i*x_j*pinv</tt> is stored in \c xi where
    * \c pinv is the inverse of \c p in Z/<tt>c</tt>Z.
    *
    * The function stops when each integer from \c cand_yi has been checked for
    * smoothness or when the \c smooth_yi array is completely filled. It then
    * returns the index of the last integer in \c cand_yi that has been checked
    * for smoothness.
    *
    * This function uses the algorithm 2.1 described in Daniel J. Bernstein's
    * paper: "How to find smooth parts of integers" except that this function
    * has been tailored to better suit the factorization problem, particularly
    * to our SIQS implementation where we need to keep track of additionnal
    * \c a_i integers associated to each \c y_i integers. These extra integers
    * are stored in \c cand_a whereas the a_i associated to the smooth y_i will
    * be stored in the \c a_for_smooth_gx array.
    *
    * \note The \c a_i integers are actually the values of the first parameter
    *       of the polynomials used in the SIQS algorithm.
