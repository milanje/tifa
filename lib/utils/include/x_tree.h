    * While an \c mpz_tree_t is just an <tt>mpz_array_t</tt>, its memory is
    * allocated in a different manner than in the \c mpz_array_t case. Indeed,
    * the elements of an \c mpz_tree_t array should NOT be modified later on
    * since the memory used is allocated in one huge block to prevent overhead
    * from multiple malloc calls. So the allocated memory of the mpz_t's in the
    * tree can NOT be increased.
    *
    * The \c mpz_tree_t typedef is introduced only as a reminder of this
    * different underlying memory allocation. \c free_mpz_tree should be
    * used to clear the memory space occupied by an <tt>mpz_tree_t</tt>. Do
    * NOT call \c free_mpz_array on an <tt>mpz_tree_t</tt>!
