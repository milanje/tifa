Here are some short term objectives:

  - Fallback strategies for all factorization functions (find more relations,
    change multiplier, etc.) to make them more robust. This is currently done
    for CFRAC and SQUFOF only and needs to be extended to SIQS.
  
  - Improve the ECM implementation. It is currently way below par
    performance wise. It should be considered as a simple toy-ECM for now.
