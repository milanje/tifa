Main bugs and outstanding issues
--------------------------------

  - BETA VERSION WARNING:

        The library is still in development and may^H^H^H certainly
        have rough edges. As a result, things may (or rather, will) crash, 
        and/or, fry your computer, burn your house, destroy the ozone layer 
        (or what's left of it) and, incidentally, give wrong results.
  
  - WARNING:
  
        - Simple large prime variation is mandatory for the time being!
          A code refactoring took place and the "no large prime"
          variation has not been "replugged" for the time being.
